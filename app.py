# Develop a function that creates a new list of pokemon based on the type the user searched for. If no pokemon was found of that type inform the user

#Develop a function to find all pokemon matching the name the user searched for. Ex. if "Char" return Charmander, Charmeleon and Charizard. Make the user aware if no pokemon was found. 

#For Leo/, help me come up with a clever final question, considering maybe showing all moves a pokemon has avaiable based on type
